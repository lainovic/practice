"""
We are going to build a code editor like IntelliJ or VSCode.
When we open a project, we should see all the artefacts (items) in that project.
Every artefact should have an icon and the icon can be different from one artefact to another.
For example, the Main fileâ€™s icon has a special green play marker on top of the icon.
Similarly, if an artefact includes errors, its icon should include an error marker.
We are simulating the rendering of these icons using simple strings.
Next, look at the current implementation of these concepts in the decorator package.
Read my comments in the Artefact class about the problems with this implementation.
Refactor the solution using the decorator pattern.
